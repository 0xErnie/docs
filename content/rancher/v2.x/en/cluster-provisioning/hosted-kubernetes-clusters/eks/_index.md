<!-- /TOC -->

## 1. Give Appropriate Permissions

Make sure that the account you will be using to create the EKS cluster has the appropriate permissions. Referring to the official [EKS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/IAM_policies.html) for details.

## 2. Create Access Key and Secret Key

Use AWS to create an access key and client secret.

1. In the AWS Console, go to the **IAM** service.

2. Select **Users**.

3. Find the user you wish to create the EKS cluster with. Select the user.

4. Click **Security Credentials**.

5. Click **Create access key**.

6. Record the **Access key ID** and **Secret access key**. You will need to use these in Rancher to create your EKS cluster.

## 3. Create the EKS Cluster

Use {{< product >}} to set up and configure your Kubernetes cluster.

1. From the **Clusters** page, click **Add Cluster**.

2. Choose **Amazon EKS**.

3. Enter a **Cluster Name**.

4. {{< step_create-cluster_member-roles >}}

1. Configure **Account Access** for the EKS cluster. Complete each drop-down and field.

    | Setting    | Description                                                                                                          |
    | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Region     | From the drop-down choose the geographical region in which to build your cluster.                                    |
    | Access Key | Enter the access key that you created in [2. Create Access Key and Secret Key](#2-create-access-key-and-secret-key). |
    | Secret Key | Enter the secret key that you created in [2. Create Access Key and Secret Key](#2-create-access-key-and-secret-key). |
        
1. Click **Next: Select Service Role**. Then choose a service role.

    Service Role | Description 
    -------------|---------------------------
    Standard: Rancher generated service role | placeholder
    Custom: Choose from your existing service roles | placeholder

1. Click **Next: Select VPC and Subnet**.

1. Choose an option for **Public IP for Worker Nodes**. Your selection for this option determines what options are available for **VPC & Subnet**.

    Option | Description
    -------|------------
    Yes | When your cluster nodes are provisioned, they're assigned a both a private and public IP address.
    No: Private IPs only | When your cluster nodes are provisioned, they're assigned only a private IP address.<br/><br/>If you choose this option, you must also choose a **VPC & Subnet** that allow your instances to access the internet. This access is required so that your worker nodes can connect to the Kubernetes control plane. 

1. Now choose a **VPC & Subnet**. Follow one of the sets of instructions below based on your selection from the previous step.


    {{% accordion id="yes" label="Public IP for Worker Nodes—Yes" %}}
If you choose to assign a public IP address to your cluster's worker nodes, you have the option of choosing between a VPC that's automatically generated by Rancher (i.e., **Standard: Rancher generated VPC and Subnet**), or a VPC that you're already created with AWS (i.e., **Custom: Choose from your existing VPC and Subnets**). Choose the option that best fits your use case.

1. Choose a **VPC and Subnet** option.

    Option | Description 
    -------|------------
    Standard: Rancher generated VPC and Subnet | While provisioning your cluster, Rancher generates a new VPC and Subnet.
    Custom: Choose from your exiting VPC and Subnets | While provisioning your cluster, Rancher configures your nodes to use a VPC and Subnet that you've already created in AWS. If you choose this option, complete the remaining steps below.

1.  If you're using **Custom: Choose from your existing VPC and Subnets**:

    (If you're using **Standard**, skip to [step 10](#security-group))
    
	1. Make sure **Custom: Choose from your existing VPC and Subnets** is selected.
	
	1. From the drop-down that displays, choose a VPC.
	
	1. Click **Next: Select Subnets**. Then choose one of the **Subnets** that displays.

    1. Click **Next: Select Security Group**.
    {{% /accordion %}}
    {{% accordion id="no" label="Public IP for Worker Nodes—No: Private IPs only" %}}
If you chose this option, you must also choose a **VPC & Subnet** that allow your instances to access the internet. This access is required so that your worker nodes can connect to the Kubernetes control plane. Follow the steps below.

>**Tip:** When using only private IP addresses, you can provide your nodes internet access by creating a VPC constructed with two subnets, a private set and a public set.  The private set should have its route tables configured to point toward a NAT in the public set.  For more information on routing traffic from private subnets, please see the [official AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_NAT_Instance.html).
    
    1. From the drop-down that displays, choose a VPC.
	
	1. Click **Next: Select Subnets**. Then choose one of the **Subnets** that displays.

    1. Click **Next: Select Security Group**.
    {{% /accordion %}}

1. <a id="security-group"></a>Choose a **Security Group**.

1. Click **Select Instance Options**, and then edit the node options available.

    Option | Description
    -------|------------
    Instance Type | placeholder
    Custom AMI Override | placeholder
    Minimum ASG Size | placeholder
    Maximum ASG Size | placeholder 

1. Click **Create**.
