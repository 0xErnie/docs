As you configure a new cluster that's provisioned using RKE, you can can choose custom Kubernetes (K8s) options.

You can configure K8s options one of two ways:

- [Rancher UI](#rancher-ui): Use the Rancher UI to select options that are commonly customized when setting up a K8s cluster.
- [Config File](#config-file): Alternatively, you can create a RKE config file to customize any option offered by K8s.
