_Available as of v2.5.6_

Kubernetes is moving away from maintaining cloud providers in-tree. vSphere has an out-of-tree cloud provider that can be used by installing the vSphere cloud provider and cloud storage plugins.

For instructions on how to install the CPI and CSI plugins after bringing up a cluster, refer to [this page.]({{<baseurl>}}/rancher/v2.x/en/cluster-admin/volumes-and-storage/out-of-tree-vsphere)
