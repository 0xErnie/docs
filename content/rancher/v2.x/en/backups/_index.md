This section is devoted to protecting your Rancher Server data in a disaster scenario.

- [Backups]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/backups/backups)

    To protect yourself from a disaster scenario, you should create Rancher backups on a regular basis.


- [Rollbacks]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/backups/rollbacks)

    If you experience a disaster scenario, or an upgrade does not complete successfully, you can restore Rancher to its last healthy backup.
