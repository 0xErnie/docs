> This section is under construction.

This section is devoted to protecting your data in a disaster scenario.

To protect yourself from a disaster scenario, you should create backups on a regular basis.

We recommend using the backup/restore application to back up Rancher and to restore it from backup.

The Helm chart for the application is available as in Rancher. After you have enabled the application, you will be able to use backup templates for Rancher, Fleet, and the Enterprise Cluster Manager.
